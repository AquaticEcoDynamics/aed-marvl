MVRVL: The AED Model Assessment, Reporting and Visualisation Library

 The AED-MARVL repository is a collection of previously-developed scripts that have been used for comparing the model and monitored datasets such as time series plots and transect plots, but has been refined with uniform and easier user interfaces. At the moment, the AED-MARVL was designed with the following features:
- One configuration file for all functions;
- Uniform outlook (font style and size, figure resolution etc) of the figures and animations;
- Option to use YAML style of configurations that can be shared with other plotting software such as R and python;
- Improved function on model prediction confidence reporting;
Currently, following plotting modules are available in AED-MARVL: 
- Time series (with options to show observational data and perform model skill assessment);
- Transect (with options to show observational data on same transect);
- Transect stacked area for comparing water quality compositions;
- Transect exceedance for comparing water quality levels against guidelines;
- Site profiling of selected water quality variables;
- Nutrient budgeting;
- Sheet plotting and animations;
- Curtain plotting and animations;
